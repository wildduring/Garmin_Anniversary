It is worth mentioning that I developed this mini program to commemorate the one-year anniversary of my girlfriend and me. Although we have been in a long-distance relationship all year, we love each other very much and firmly believe that we can always be together. Thank you for her company, which has brought waves to my unchanging life. Blessing us~
## Supported devices
I have selected all the devices, but I only have one fenex 7, so this mini program has only been tested on real machines on fenex 7.
## Illustrate
This mini program includes a Glance and a View. You can choose up to 5 anniversaries, of course you must choose at least one. The first anniversary you set will be displayed in Glance. The commemorative day in View supports changing icons, and the icons displayed in Glance can only be program icons.<br>
